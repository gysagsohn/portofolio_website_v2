# portofolio_website_v2

As part of my coding bootcamp, I was required to create a portfolio website. My first attempt can be found here:

- Website: https://gysohn.com/
- Repository: https://github.com/gysagsohn/gysohn_T1A2

The first portfolio was built using only HTML and CSS (SCSS). To showcase my work and further practice my JavaScript and React skills, I am now developing a second version of my portfolio website, which will include the following pages:

- **Home Page**
- **Blog Page**
- **Contact me page**

## Home Page 
The home page will introduce who I am, with a picture and a brief bio. I plan to include a timeline that outlines my career change into tech, with links to some of my key projects.

## Blog Page
The blog page will display my key works and blog posts, where I'll share my thoughts and progress. I aim to find a plugin or library that will help manage the blogging functionality.

## Contact me page 
A simple page with links to my LinkedIn, Instagram, and GitHub profiles. I would like to include a "Leave a Message" section that sends emails directly to me, although Iâ€™ll explore the feasibility of this feature as I develop the site.

## Project Management
I will manage this project using a Trello board with the Agile methodology and story points to track tasks and progress.
