# portofolio_website_v2

As part of my coding bootcamp, I was required to create a portfolio website. My first attempt can be found here:

- Website: https://gysohn.com/
- Repository: https://github.com/gysagsohn/gysohn_T1A2

The first portfolio was built using only HTML and CSS (SCSS). To showcase my work and further practice my JavaScript and React skills, I am now developing a second version of my portfolio website, which will include the following pages:

- **Home Page**
- **Blog Page**
- **Contact me page**

## Home Page 
The home page will introduce who I am, with a picture and a brief bio. I plan to include a timeline that outlines my career change into tech, with links to some of my key projects.

## Blog Page
The blog page will display my key works and blog posts, where I'll share my thoughts and progress. I aim to find a plugin or library that will help manage the blogging functionality.

## Contact me page 
A simple page with links to my LinkedIn, Instagram, and GitHub profiles. I would like to include a "Leave a Message" section that sends emails directly to me, although Iâ€™ll explore the feasibility of this feature as I develop the site.

## Project Management
I will manage this project using a Trello board with the Agile methodology and story points to track tasks and progress.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
